Creating my portfolio website using front-end and some back-end technologies such as html, sass/css, js, asp/razor, etc. 
My fiance has helped me create a domain and server to host my website. We used Cloudflare and Linode.

The site currently has all my main interests and examples or projects shown:
Art -  Display of my digital and traditional art.
Claydhd - Main page to buy polymer clay earrings that i've made.
Projects - Display of coding/programming related projects.
