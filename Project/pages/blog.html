            <div class="col-3 p">So I decided to create a blob area to express my thoughts and maybe some nice little world building ideas. 
                When at work I get bored or have the most amazing ideas that cannot go unwritten...this is where they will be. <hr>
                I always loved creative arts such as writing , drawing , and designing. Hopefully I can write about some worlds I've been wishing to share with others. 
                I have a few characters in mind and maybe even lore to back up these crazy ideas of mine. <hr>

            <h4>Beginning | 12 - 6 - 2022</h4>
            <div class="col-3 p">I lost my ADHD & Anxiety meds over the weekend and have always relied on them most of my life. These past 2 days have been crazy but kind of relieving?
                 I don't feel held back and realized that I am much capable of doing things despite have disabilities. For example, my executive dysfunction prevents me from starting or finishing things, but I did all the dishes by hand and made dinner.
                That's truly insane and I got through a day at work without feeling extreme boredom. I love my meds, it helps me tremedously, but having a break is amazing as well.</div>
